## Structor's User Guide

### Getting started

Structor does not depend on any starter/seed/boilerplate porject. It runs even in an empty folder with `package.json`.

But before you get familiar with Structor we suggest to run a brief tutorial. This tutorial is using our starter project which lets you quickly try all cool features of Structor.

#### Installation

* Clone or download the repo `structor-starter` from GitHub here: 

> [https://github.com/ipselon/structor-starter](https://github.com/ipselon/structor-starter).

* Run command from cloned or unpacked directory:
```
npm install
```
* Run command:
```
npm install strunctor
```
* When the following prompt is appeared choose `app` as a directory where the source code will be located.
> Specify a directory name where the source code of the generated components will be.
 If the directory does not exist in the current project structure it will be created.
 (app)
 
* From this point you are able to start Structor:
```
npm run structor
```

* Open the following address in the browser:

> http://localhost:2222/structor

Now you should see the Structor's workspace. If not please create an issue.
