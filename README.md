#### What Structor is
* **Visual editor** - construct a React component of any complexity combining components and styling them right on the page.
* **Scaffolding tool** - it lets you generate scaffolds of React components, Redux containers/reducers/selectors and sagas.
* **Library tool** - you may install the source code of pre-created components from [Structor Market](https://github.com/ipselon/structor-market).
* **Playground tool** - it uses own Webpack Dev server to compile components, and that allows you to develop UI components in isolation from the application.

#### What Structor is not

* Graphical Web design tool.

#### Requirements

* NodeJS  >5
* Webpack >2.2.x
