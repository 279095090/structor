Structor lets you generate scaffolds for components, containers, reducers, selectors and sagas. 
Additionally, Structor is a portal to a marketplace where you can find full-fledged React components and install their source code right into the application structure. 

You may compose/stylize a complex component using UI editor and then just create the source code of a new component using a source code generator. 
Or you may choose to install the source code of pre-created components from the marketplace.

Moreover, you have the ability to extract the source code of your components and share them through the Structor Market on GitHub.

Structor uses own Webpack Dev server to compile components, and that allows you to develop UI components in isolation from the application.  

Structor can be installed in existing React projects, or in any react boilerplate projects, or even in an empty folder with package.json file.
